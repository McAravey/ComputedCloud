# Computing in the Cloud

Cloud computing has made its way into the spotlight in the last decade or so, and with it came new ways to architect systems to run in the cloud. Many articles, demos, and explications simply focus on The basics of each service provided by the cloud. They don't cover in detail grand pictures or architectural designs, and usually don't provide much in the way of samples and real life code. here we start our long journey talking about the cloud, and how this new computing platform changes the way rewrite application.

I do want to point out that I have a focus on the Microsoft azure cloud. I'm going to talk about many of the services provided by Azure, but hopefully many of the architectural discussions will be applicable in other cloud environments.

## Series
Throughout this blog the article will be a part of one of these series. Note that this is not a definitive list:
* **Azure in the real world**: Heavy on examples, gotchas, and real scenarios.
* **Cloud architecture**: Architectural discussions, not usually focused on code. Covering various products.
* **Expert Azure/Asp.Net/etc...**: In depth detail about a single product or feature. More details than the real world topics.
* **Tips and Tricks**: Quick little tidbits about things to do with Azure (or whatever else). Very light on content. Shorter than a full article
